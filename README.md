INSTALL INFORMATION

In continuing the classic GitHub tradition of making install guides that are unhelpful and unnecessarily long:

Step one:
For WINDOWS COMPUTERS:
Follow the 2 steps for installing CodeBlocks that can be found in this document:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pkEd37jxLkB8w0BWpj63UCe_fc2N1htyoh7MPCyRl-w/edit#heading=h.wrgp6c9g4k4k

Then follow the 3rd step for installing Allegro.

For MAC OS USERS

Follow the 2.5 step for installing CodeBlocks, then use Michael Cong's install guide that can be found here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QWahUib8bKa5aMw1STQLH1v3pQ6K5F0mZTrLuINm0Kc/edit


Step two:

Download the zip file for Paintball Roulette from the GitHub page, unzip it then open it and go to the .cbp file, double click it. Codeblocks should run, then press the green button on CodeBlocks to start.

And then you are done!
